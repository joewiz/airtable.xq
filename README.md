A library for the Airtable Web API, using XQuery

## Overview

The library module in the `content` directory contains functions for 
communicating with [Airtable’s Web API](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) 
via XQuery. To use the library module, either import it directly from the 
content directory, or [install](#requirements) or [build](#building-from-source) 
the package and import the library module with:

```xquery
import module namespace airtable="http://joewiz.org/ns/xquery/airtable";
```

The library contains the following functions, all of which require a personal
access token or a service account access token from Airtable.

### Web API functions

#### General

- `airtable:get-user-info()`

#### Base Data

##### Bases

- `airtable:list-bases()`
- `airtable:get-base-schema()`

##### Records

- `airtable:create-records()`
- `airtable:retrieve-record()`
- `airtable:list-records()`
- `airtable:update-records()`
- `airtable:delete-records()`

### How it works

The library sends requests to the Airtable API using the EXPath HTTP Client
library. (See eXist notes below.)

Successful responses (with status 200) are returned with the response body’s 
JSON object parsed as a map. 

When a response indicates an error (a non-200 status), the library’s 
functions all return a map with an "error" entry, with subentries to aid in 
debugging: request, response head and body, rate limit assessments, start and 
end dateTimes, and duration in seconds.

Function documentation is adapted from the Airtable API to conform to XQuery 
style conventions. XDM terminology replaces JSON terminology, and parameters 
are kebab case rather than camel case. 

### XQuery compatibility

The library uses standard XQuery 3.1, but is dependent on eXist in two areas:

1. eXist’s EXPath HTTP Client module returns JSON as xs:base64Binary, so 
`util:binary-to-string()` is always needed before the JSON can be parsed.

2. To prevent hitting the Airtable API’s rate limits, we use eXist’s 
`cache` module to store the dateTime of the last request. If a delay is needed
before a request can be submitted, the `util:wait()` function is used.

To adapt the library to another processor, you may adapt these `util` and 
`cache` functions to those of your processor. 

### Caveats

- The "typecast" parameter for automatic data conversion for list, create, and 
update actions hasn’t been implemented.
- No special handling for User and Server error codes except rate limits; 
instead, full HTTP response headers are returned.

### About this repository

Thanks to @duncdrum for his contributions to [generator-exist](https://github.com/eXist-db/generator-exist)
tool, which generated all of the scaffolding for this app—EXPath package 
descriptors, GitHub templates, and GitHub Actions actions. I used the "blank" 
template. I've made only minimal changes to the assets generated by this tool.

More recently, I've adopted the CI approach used by @duncdrum in [aws.xq](https://github.com/HistoryAtState/aws.xq).

## Requirements

*   [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org) version: `5.0.0` or greater

*   [ant](https://ant.apache.org) version: `1.10.7` \(for building from source\)

*   [node](https://nodejs.org) version: `12.x` \(for building from source\)
    

## Installation

1.  Download the `airtable.xq.xar` file from GitHub [releases](https://github.com/joewiz/airtable.xq/releases) page.

2.  Open the [Dashboard](http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html) on your eXist-db instance and click on `Package Manager`.

    1.  Click on the `Upload` button in the upper left corner and select the `.xar` file you just downloaded.

3.  You have successfully installed airtable.xq into eXist.

### Building from source

1.  Download, fork or clone this GitHub repository
2.  There are two default build targets in `build.xml`:
    *   `dev` including *all* files from the source folder including those with potentially sensitive information.
  
    *   `deploy` is the official release. It excludes files necessary for development but that have no effect upon deployment.
  
3.  Calling `ant`in your CLI will build both files:
  
```bash
cd airtable.xq
ant
```

   1. to only build a specific target call either `dev` or `deploy` like this:
   ```bash   
   ant dev
   ```   

If you see `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` ant has generated a `airtable.xq-*.xar` file in the `build/` folder. To install it, follow the instructions [above](#installation).



## Running Tests

To run tests locally your app needs to be installed in a running exist-db instance at the default port `8080` and with the default dba user `admin` with the default empty password.

A quick way to set this up for docker users is to simply issue:

```bash
docker run -dit -p 8080:8080 existdb/existdb:release
```

After you finished installing the application, you can run the full testsuite locally.

### Unit-tests

This app uses [mochajs](https://mochajs.org) as a test-runner. To run both xquery and javascript unit-tests type:

```bash
npm test
```

### Integration-tests

This app uses [cypress](https://www.cypress.io) for integration tests, just type:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

Alternatively, use npx:

```bash
npx cypress open
```
